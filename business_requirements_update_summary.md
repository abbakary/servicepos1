# Business Requirements Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the application to reflect new business requirements:
1. Only deal with NEW tire condition (removed Used and Refurbished)
2. Remove Bodaboda customer type
3. Fix customer group order counts

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates (`tracker/models.py`)
- **Customer.TYPE_CHOICES**: Removed `("bodaboda", "Bodaboda")`
- **get_icon_for_customer_type()**: Removed bodaboda icon mapping
- **Result**: Only 4 customer types remain: Government, NGO, Private Company, Personal

### 2. View Updates (`tracker/views.py`)
#### Analytics Views
- **reports_advanced**: Removed bodaboda from customer type charts
- **analytics_customer**: Removed bodaboda from type distribution
- **customer_groups**: Fixed order count calculations with `distinct=True`
- **organization_management**: Fixed order count calculations

#### Customer Group Order Count Fix
- Added `distinct=True` to all Count() aggregations
- Added `total_orders_count` field for accurate counting
- Fixed issue where orders created from both pages were double-counted

### 3. Template Updates
#### Automated Updates (2 templates updated):
- **customers_list.html**: Removed bodaboda references
- **customer_registration_form.html**: Removed used/refurbished tire options

#### Manual Verification Needed:
- All forms with tire type selection should only show "New"
- All customer type dropdowns should only show 4 options
- Analytics charts should reflect 4 customer types only

### 4. Data Migration Requirements
Created `update_existing_data.py` script to:
- Convert existing bodaboda customers to personal type
- Convert existing used/refurbished tire orders to new type

## Business Impact

### Tire Types
**Before**: New, Used, Refurbished  
**After**: New only

### Customer Types
**Before**: Government, NGO, Private Company, Personal, Bodaboda  
**After**: Government, NGO, Private Company, Personal

### Customer Group Analytics
**Before**: Incorrect order counts due to duplicate counting  
**After**: Accurate order counts using distinct aggregation

3. `tracker/templates/tracker/customers_list.html` - Customer type references
